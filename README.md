# ECOGR essay
Final project of Computer Graphics course taken during my Erasmus exchange at Warsaw University of Technology.

## Polygon rendering methods, Phong illumination equations
We will dwell in detail on the topics of polygon rendering, where we will discuss about the
different types of rendering such as:
• Constant-Intensity Shading (flat shading);
• Gouraud Shading;
• Phong Shading;
The first two will be discussed quickly and not in great depth, in fact the focus will be on
the topic regarding Phong Shading and Phong illumination equation.
